Title: Analyzing STR polymorphisms from trio datasets of 1000 Genomes Project

The phase 3 of 1000 Genomes Project has 602 trio samples with whole genome sequencing datasets to a depth of 30x and PCR-free library preparation method. We have picked out genotypes of 5.458 million (5,458,380) STR loci from these samples using HipSTR tool and have compared genotypes to identify de novo mutation occurring in the offspring.




Summary:

STRs or Short tandem repeats are DNA elements which have short motifs repeated in tandem. STRs are highly polymorphic in nature and infamous for causing almost 40 expansion related neuro muscular degenerative diseases in humans. Growing evidence suggests that apart from causing disease by  abnormal expansions, subtle length changes of polymorphic STRs contribute to regulation of gene expression. Population scale whole genome sequencing data allows us to understand the variability in STRs and specifically trio datasets are more informative about the events of polymorphism. Here we utilize the phase 3 WGS datasets of the 1000 Genomes Project which includes 3200 individual samples from 5 super populations and about 600 trio datasets.
